MedTrack-FHIR
=======================================

Project Overview
MedTrack-FHIR is a comprehensive application designed to integrate multiple MDCalc equations into a single, user-friendly platform. This project leverages the power of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to ensure seamless data integration and interoperability within healthcare environments.

Features
Multi-Equation Support: Incorporates a variety of MDCalc equations, such as the Cockcroft-Gault Equation for Creatinine Clearance, Body Roundness Index (BRI), Fibrotic NASH Index (FNI), LDL Cholesterol Calculation, Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), and Serum Ascites Albumin Gradient (SAAG).

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate UI for healthcare professionals to quickly and accurately perform calculations.

FHIR Integration: Ensures compatibility and interoperability with existing healthcare systems by adhering to the FHIR standard.

Real-Time Validation: Provides real-time validation of input data against predefined JSON schemas.

Detailed Outputs: Delivers precise calculation results with comprehensive descriptions and clinical interpretations.
